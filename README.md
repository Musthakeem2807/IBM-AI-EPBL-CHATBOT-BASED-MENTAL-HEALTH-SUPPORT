1. Problem Understanding and Overview
Mental health has become a critical area of concern globally, with rising cases of stress, anxiety, depression, and related conditions. Access to timely and personalized support remains limited due to factors like stigma, high costs, lack of mental health professionals, and geographic barriers.

Problem Summary:
Limited Access to Mental Health Services: Many individuals do not seek help due to social stigma or insufficient local services.

Overburdened Healthcare Systems: Mental health professionals are often overwhelmed, resulting in long wait times and reduced service quality.

Challenges in Delivering Support:
24/7 Availability and Responsiveness: Human counselors cannot always be available round-the-clock to provide immediate emotional assistance.

Personalization and Context Awareness: Designing a chatbot that can understand user context, mood, and history to respond empathetically and appropriately.

Data Privacy and Ethical Concerns: Ensuring user conversations remain confidential and that AI recommendations are ethically sound and safe.

Objectives of the Chatbot Solution:
Provide Scalable, Non-Judgmental Support: Offer consistent and accessible support for individuals at any time, anywhere.

Early Detection and Guidance: Recognize signs of distress and guide users toward helpful resources or professionals.

Mental Wellness Promotion: Engage users with techniques like journaling, breathing exercises, or mood tracking to build resilience.

2. Key Features of the Chatbot-Based System
Natural Language Understanding (NLU):

Conversational Flows for Mental Support:

Offer mood tracking, positive reinforcement, and goal-setting.

Emergency Escalation:

Recognize crisis language and immediately refer the user to a human therapist or emergency contact.

Privacy and Ethical Safeguards:

End-to-end encryption and anonymized data handling.

Clearly disclose limitations and ensure users know they are talking to a bot.
